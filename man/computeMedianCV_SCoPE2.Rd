\title{(Deprecated) Compute the median coefficient of variation (CV) per
cell}
\usage{
computeMedianCV_SCoPE2(object, i, peptideCol, proteinCol, batchCol)
}
\description{
This function is deprecated and should no longer be used. To
reproduce the SCoPE2 script, you can now use \code{medianCVperCell}
with the following arguments:

\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{norm = "SCoPE2"}
\item \code{nobs = 6}
}

Make sure to provide the peptide data in separate assays so that
the normalization factors are computed per batch.
