  abstract = "Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has undergone
              rapid development in recent years, leading to an explosion in the
              number of tailored data analysis methods. However, the current
              lack of gold-standard benchmark datasets makes it difficult for
              researchers to systematically compare the performance of the many
              methods available. Here, we generated a realistic benchmark
              experiment that included single cells and admixtures of cells or
              RNA to create 'pseudo cells' from up to five distinct cancer cell
              lines. In total, 14 datasets were generated using both droplet
              and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols. We compared 3,913
              combinations of data analysis methods for tasks ranging from
              normalization and imputation to clustering, trajectory analysis
              and data integration. Evaluation revealed pipelines suited to
              different types of data for different tasks. Our data and
              analysis provide a comprehensive framework for benchmarking most
              common scRNA-seq analysis steps.",
