  abstract = "Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
              (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in
              microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of
              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global
              retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates
              towards improved confidence estimates of
              peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell
              samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30-50\%
              at 1\% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate
              excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and
              support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as
              identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The
              additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical
              power and double the number of proteins identified as
              differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be
              applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available

              empirical Bayes methods",
  author   = "Johnson, W Evan and Li, Cheng and Rabinovic, Ariel",
  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that
              our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in
              practice. Software for our method is freely available at:

  abstract = "The fate and physiology of individual cells are controlled by
              networks of proteins. Yet, our ability to quantitatively analyze
              protein networks in single cells has remained limited. To
              overcome this barrier, we developed SCoPE2. It integrates
              concepts from Single-Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry
              (SCoPE-MS) with automated and miniaturized sample preparation,
              substantially lowering cost and hands-on time. SCoPE2 uses
              data-driven analytics to optimize instrument parameters for
              sampling more ion copies per protein, thus supporting
              quantification with improved count statistics. These advances
              enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as
              homogeneous monocytes differentiated into macrophage-like cells
              in the absence of polarizing cytokines. We used SCoPE2 to
              quantify over 2,000 proteins in 356 single monocytes and
              macrophages in about 85 hours of instrument time, and the
              quantified proteins allowed us to discern single cells by cell
              type. Furthermore, the data uncovered a continuous gradient of
              proteome states for the macrophage-like cells, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge even in the absence of
              polarizing cytokines. Our methodology lays the foundation for
              quantitative analysis of protein networks at single-cell

  abstract = "Abstract Label-Free Quantitative mass spectrometry based
              workflows for differential expression (DE) analysis of proteins
              impose important challenges on the data analysis due to
              peptide-specific effects and context dependent missingness of
              peptide intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test
              for DE directly from peptide intensities and outper-form
              summarization methods which first aggregate MS1 peptide
              intensities to protein intensities before DE analysis. However,
              these methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
              understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do not provide
              protein summaries, which are important for visualisation or
              downstream processing. In this work, we therefore evaluate
              state-of-the-art summarization strategies using a benchmark
              spike-in dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared to
              the state-of-the-art peptide based model, MSqRob. Based on this
              evaluation, we propose a novel summarization strategy,
              MSqRob-Sum, which estimates MSqRob's model parameters in a
              two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of peptide-based
              workflows. MSqRobSum maintains MSqRob's superior performance,
              while providing useful protein expression summaries for plotting
              and downstream analysis. Summarising peptide to protein
              intensities considerably reduces the computational complexity,
              the memory footprint and the model complexity, and makes it
              easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries. Moreover,
              MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework, which
              provides researchers with full flexibility to develop data
              analysis workflows tailored towards their specific applications.",
