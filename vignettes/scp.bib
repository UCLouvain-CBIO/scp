  abstract = "MaxQuant is one of the most frequently used platforms for
              mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data analysis. Since its
              first release in 2008, it has grown substantially in
              functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS
              platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the most
              important basic computational workflows, including those designed
              for quantitative label-free proteomics, MS1-level labeling and
              isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol presents a complete
              description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the
              configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda.
              This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing
              protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important
              concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in
              MaxQuant are briefly reviewed, including different quantification
              strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as
              well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
              The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information about
              quantification of proteins and PTMs, are explained in detail.
              Furthermore, we provide a short version of the workflow that is
              applicable to data sets with simple and standard experimental
              designs. The MaxQuant algorithms are efficiently parallelized on
              multiple processors and scale well from desktop computers to
              servers with many cores. The software is written in C\# and is
              freely available at http://www.maxquant.org.",

              (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in
              microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of
              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global
              retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates
              towards improved confidence estimates of
              peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell
              samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30-50\%
              at 1\% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate
              excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and
              support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as
              identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The
              additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical
              power and double the number of proteins identified as
              differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be
              applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Macrophages are innate immune cells with diverse
              functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely
              unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of the
              limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis.
              RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, we develop SCoPE2, which
              substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput
              while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated
              and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to
              analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous
              monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence
              of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantifies over 3042 proteins in
              1490 single monocytes and macrophages in 10 days of instrument
              time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single
              cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous
              gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing
              cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10$\times$
              Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more
              protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus, SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. This
              allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as interactions
              between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the
              transcripts of genes regulated by p53. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a
              homogeneous environment, macrophage proteomes are heterogeneous.
              This heterogeneity correlates to the inflammatory axis of
              classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Our
              methodology lays the foundation for automated and quantitative
              single-cell analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry and
              demonstrates the potential for inferring transcriptional and
              post-transcriptional regulation from variability across single
              cells.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively
              embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses. Indeed,
              recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS)
              have enabled the emergence of quantitative MS-based single-cell
              proteomics (SCP). While exciting and promising, SCP still has
              many rough edges. The current analysis workflows are custom and
              built from scratch. The field is therefore craving for
              standardized software that promotes principled and reproducible
              SCP data analyses. AREAS COVERED: This special report is the
              first step toward the formalization and standardization of SCP
              data analysis. scp, the software that accompanies this work,
              successfully replicates one of the landmark SCP studies and is
              applicable to other experiments and designs. We created a
              repository containing the replicated workflow with comprehensive
              documentation in order to favor further dissemination and
              improvements of SCP data analyses. EXPERT OPINION: Replicating
              SCP data analyses uncovers important challenges in SCP data
              analysis. We describe two such challenges in detail: batch
              correction and data missingness. We provide the current
              state-of-the-art and illustrate the associated limitations. We
              also highlight the intimate dependence that exists between batch
              effects and data missingness and offer avenues for dealing with
              these exciting challenges.",
