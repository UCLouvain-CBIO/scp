  abstract      = "Missing values are a notable challenge when analysing mass
                   spectrometry-based proteomics data. While the field is still
                   actively debating on the best practices, the challenge
                   increased with the emergence of mass spectrometry-based
                   single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing
                   values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to
                   perform imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for
                   which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still
                   a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell
                   proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the
                   advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5
                   main challenges linked to missing value management in
                   single-cell proteomics. Future developments should aim to
                   solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or
                   data modelling. The perspective concludes with
                   recommendations for reporting missing values, for reporting
                   methods that deal with missing values and for proper
                   encoding of missing values.",

  abstract  = "Many modern analytical methods are used to analyse samples
               coming from an experimental design, for example, in medical,
               biological, or agronomic fields. Those methods generate most of
               the time highly multivariate data like spectra or images. This
               is the case of ``omics'' technologies used to detect genes
               (genomics), mRNA (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), or
               metabolites (metabolomics) in a specific biological sample.
               Those technologies produce high‐dimensional multivariate
               databases where the number of variables (descriptors) tends to
               be much larger than the number of experimental units. Moreover,
               experiments in omics often follow designs aimed at understanding
               the effect of several factors on biological systems. Therefore,
               multivariate statistical tools are needed to highlight variables
               that are consistently modified by different biological states.
               It is in this context that 2 recent methods combine analysis of
               variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA), namely,
               ASCA (ANOVA--simultaneous component analysis) and APCA
               (ANOVA‐PCA). They provide powerful tools to visualize
               multivariate structures in the space of each effect of the
               statistical model linked to the experimental design. Their main
               limitation is that they provide biased estimators of the factor
               effects when the design of experiment is unbalanced. This paper
               introduces 2 new methods, ASCA+ and APCA+, that allow,
               respectively, to extend the use of ASCA and APCA to unbalanced
               designs using several principles from the theory of general
               linear models. Both methods are applied on real‐life
               metabolomics data, clearly demonstrating the capacity of ASCA+
               and APCA+ methods to highlight correct biomarkers corresponding
               to effects of interest in unbalanced designs.",

  author   = "Leduc, Andrew and Huffman, R Gray and Cantlon, Joshua and Khan,
              Saad and Slavov, Nikolai",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many biological processes, such as cell division
              cycle and drug resistance, are reflected in protein covariation
              across single cells. This covariation can be quantified and
              interpreted by single-cell mass spectrometry with sufficiently
              high throughput and accuracy. RESULTS: Here, we describe nPOP, a
              method that enables simultaneous sample preparation of thousands
              of single cells, including lysing, digesting, and labeling
              individual cells in volumes of 8-20 nl. nPOP uses piezo acoustic
              dispensing to isolate individual cells in 300 pl volumes and
              performs all subsequent sample preparation steps in small
              droplets on a fluorocarbon-coated glass slide. Protein
              covariation analysis identifies cell cycle dynamics that are
              similar and dynamics that differ between cell types, even within
              subpopulations of melanoma cells delineated by markers for drug
              resistance priming. Melanoma cells expressing these markers
              accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, display distinct
              protein covariation across the cell cycle, accumulate glycogen,
              and have lower abundance of glycolytic enzymes. The non-primed
              melanoma cells exhibit gradients of protein abundance, suggesting
              transition states. Within this subpopulation, proteins
              functioning in oxidative phosphorylation covary with each other
              and inversely with proteins functioning in glycolysis. This
              protein covariation suggests divergent reliance on energy sources
              and its association with other biological functions. These
              results are validated by different mass spectrometry methods.
              CONCLUSIONS: nPOP enables flexible, automated, and highly
              parallelized sample preparation for single-cell proteomics. This
              allows for quantifying protein covariation across thousands of
              single cells and revealing functionally concerted biological
              differences between closely related cell states. Support for nPOP

              first release in 2008, it has grown substantially in
              functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS
              platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the most
              important basic computational workflows, including those designed
              for quantitative label-free proteomics, MS1-level labeling and
              isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol presents a complete
              description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the
              configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda.
              This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing
              protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important
              concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in
              MaxQuant are briefly reviewed, including different quantification
              strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as
              well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
              The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information about

              microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of
              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global
              retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates
              towards improved confidence estimates of
              peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell
              samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30-50\%

              functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely
              unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of the
              limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis.
              RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, we develop SCoPE2, which
              substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput
              while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated
              and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to
              analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous
              monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence
              of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantifies over 3042 proteins in
              1490 single monocytes and macrophages in 10 days of instrument
              time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single
              cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous
              gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing
              cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10$\times$
              Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more
              protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus, SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. This
              allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as interactions
              between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the
              transcripts of genes regulated by p53. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a
              homogeneous environment, macrophage proteomes are heterogeneous.
              This heterogeneity correlates to the inflammatory axis of
              classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Our

              single-cell analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry and
